# Book Connect - JavaScript Code Review and Recommendations 📚

**Author:** Dylan Gangat 🙋‍♂️

## 🎯 Project Overview

Book Connect already has an impressive HTML and CSS codebase, but the JavaScript code needs improvement. The previous freelance developer didn't deliver functional code, causing multiple errors. Your challenge is to spend a week delving into the codebase, rectify critical issues, and compile recommendations into a slideshow for the team.

## User Stories 📖

To meet the client's requirements and user expectations, I focused on fulfilling the following prioritized user stories:

1. **View Book Previews:** As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, including title, author, and an associated image, to discover new books to read.

2. **Read Book Summaries:** As a user, I want to read a summary of each book so I can decide whether I want to read it.

3. **Publication Date:** As a user, I want to see the publication date of each book to determine its availability in the second-hand market.

4. **Search by Text Phrases:** As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases to easily locate books without remembering their full titles.

5. **Filter by Author:** As a user, I want to filter books by author to discover new books from my favorite authors.

6. **Filter by Genre:** As a user, I want to filter books by genre to explore books in genres I enjoy.

7. **Dark and Light Modes:** As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes for comfortable app usage at night.

## Code Review and Improvements 🔧

During the week-long audit, I identified several areas for improvement in the existing codebase:

1. Fix critical JavaScript errors.
2. Perform a full audit of the existing code.
3. Improve performance, readability, and future maintainability.
4. Implement prioritized user stories from the current backlog.

## Conclusion 🎉

Working on the Book Connect Final Capstone Project has been both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to showcase my skills and grow as a junior developer.
